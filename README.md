# Disaster-Tweet-Prediction (NLP)
Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency and more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).

But, it’s not always clear whether a person’s words are actually announcing a disaster. In this project, I built a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t based on a dataset of 10,000 tweets that were hand classified.
